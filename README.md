# About
A 2D Platformer, designed using Unity, in which the player must control the character and their companion, Pixie, in order to climb the lighthouse and escape the darkness inside. Pixie acts as your main light source, allowing you to scout the abyss while also acting as a beacon to distract enemies and light torches. This game was created on a team of 6 for the Ludum Dare 54 Game Jam.

### How to Play

### Background
This game was built in 48 hours and submitted for the Ludum Dare 54 Game Jam. The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/AriveIT/Game-Jam-Game). For the competition, I participated in a team of 6 with 3 other programmers and 2 artists.

The game was designed around the theme for the Game Jam: "Limited Space". Based on the theme, our team wanted to create a game that felt cramped, offering players little room to work with. From there, we came up with the idea of limited light using the darkness as our main method to keep the player enclosed. The rest of the mechanics followed shortly after
